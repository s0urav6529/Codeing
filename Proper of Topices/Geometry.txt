****************** Coplanar test ************************

Show that 3 points are in the same straight line. A (x1, y1) B (x2, y2) & C (x3, y3).
They will be coplanar if the area of the triangle bounded by these three points is 0.

Area=x1*(y2-y3) +x2*(y3-y1) +x3*(y1-y2)

If (Area==0) they are coplanar.
